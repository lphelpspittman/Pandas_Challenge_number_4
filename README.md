This analysis of PyCity Schools takes a comprehensive look at the number of schools within this district, the number of students within each school, and identifying the different school models.  We then take a look at the total budget per school and break these numbers down to find spending per capita within the school.  We also find average math and reading scores as well as the percentage of students who passed each subject as well as the percentage who passed both subjects.  This analysis allows us to find correlations between population, school type, budget and student test scores.

Collaborated with Savannah Porter (student) and received help debugging from John Wagner (instructor).
